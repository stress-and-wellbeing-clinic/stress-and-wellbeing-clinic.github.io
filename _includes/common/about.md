###Approach

In the UK over 13 million working days are lost every year because of stress. Stress is believed to
trigger 70% of visits to doctors, and 85% of serious illnesses (UK HSE stress statistics). It can be hard
for organisations to accept they have problems with stress management amongst their employees;
whilst many employees don't wish to own up to feeling stressed for fear of appearing unable to cope.

them strengthen resilience and increase productivity. We do this by helping to identify the source of
stressors and derive effective solutions using strength-based resources.

###What is Coaching

Coaching is defined as “a collaborative solution-focused, results-orientated and systematic
process in which the coach facilitates the enhancement of work performance, life experience,
self-directed learning and personal growth of the coachee." (The Association for Coaching, 2014)
Stress Coaching is a form of support for individuals to manage their stressors in any area of their lives
including career, relationships, health, finances.

At {{site.title}}, our coaching
style is confidential, collaborative and empowering with the core belief that the client know what
they want and need, and my job is to help unlock it faster than they probably would have done
on they own. Coaching is focused purely on the client’s agenda, and thus the client’s wellbeing is
paramount.
